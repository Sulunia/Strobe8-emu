Strobe8-emu
===========

A blinky-buggy CHIP8 Emulator using cout for graphics. Currently abandoned.


The original premise was to develop and finish a fully functional CHIP8 emulator using the console COUT for
graphics output. The project is still not over tough. Todo list includes coding input emulation, coding
SCHIP and maybe MEGACHIP opcodes, and finally, using a real graphics engine in order to make a nice emulator
overall.

This was my first "big" coding project, and really worked well to improve my logic and algorithm knowledge.
